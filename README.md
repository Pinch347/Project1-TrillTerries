Documentation: Trill Terries NFT Website
Introduction
The Trill Terries NFT Website is a simple, static HTML, CSS-based website that showcases the Trill Terries NFT collection, its roadmap, and a contact form for users to get in touch with the team.
Requirements
Web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom)
A local web server (optional, for local testing, e.g., Live Server extension for Visual Studio Code)
Installation Instructions
Download the project files from the provided source (e.g., GitHub repository, ZIP file, etc.).
Extract the files to a folder on your local machine.
Open the project folder using your preferred code editor.
If you want to test the website locally, install a local web server. For Visual Studio Code users, you can install the "Live Server" extension.
With the "Live Server" extension installed, right-click on the index.html file in your code editor and select "Open with Live Server." Your default web browser will open the website.
Project Structure
The Trill Terries NFT Website consists of the following files and folders:
index.html: The home page of the website.
roadmap.html: The roadmap page, which shows the planned phases for the project.
contact.html: The contact page, containing a form for users to send messages to the team.
css/: A folder containing the CSS files.
style.css: The main CSS file, which contains all the styling for the website.
Execution
To view the website:
If you are using the "Live Server" extension in Visual Studio Code, the website should already be open in your default web browser.
If you are not using a local web server, open the index.html file directly in your web browser. To navigate between pages, click on the navigation links at the top of the page.
Comments
Throughout the HTML and CSS files, you will find comments that explain the structure and styling of the website. These comments will help you understand the code and make modifications as needed.
For example, in the index.html file, you will find comments explaining the different sections of the page, such as the header, main content, and footer:


<!-- Header -->
<header>
  ...
</header>


<!-- Main content -->
<main>
  ...
</main>


<!-- Footer -->
<footer>
  ...
</footer>








Similarly, in the style.css file, you will find comments explaining the different CSS rules:






/* General styles */
...


/* Header */
...


/* Roadmap */
...


/* Footer */
...
These comments serve as a guide to help you understand the structure and styling of the website, making it easier for you to make changes and maintain the code.
